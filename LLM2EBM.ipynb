Passengers from the planet Europa have the highest probability of being transported, while those from Earth have the lowest. Choosing cryosleep increases the likelihood of being transported. Passengers staying in cabins labeled \"C/S\" and \"C/P\" are more likely to be transported, while those in \"G/P\" and \"A/P\" are less likely. The destination also plays a role, with passengers destined for \"55 Cancri e\" having a higher probability.
