    \nThe information of each graph is stored in a list variable "ft_graph". When you need to use the data in "ft_graph" to draw a picture, you do not need to print the data to generate the code with data yourself. You only need to organize the data into the variable 'data' in the dataframe format, and directly take this variable data to draw the picture.
    "ft_graph" is a method type variable. You can use this method to get the dic variable of the corresponding feature. The parameter of the method should be the serial number of the feature. For example, assuming that the feature sequence is: name, age, time. Then you can use 'ft_graph(0)' instead of 'ft_graph[0]' to access the dic data for the 'Age' feature, which including four keys: 'names', 'scores', 'upper_bounds' and 'lower_bounds'. 
    If the type of this feature is 'continuous', You must draw a step-line chart instead of a base line chart. The number in the 'names' array variable will be used as the abscissa of the graph, and it will contain float cut points that separate continuous values into bins. The 'scores' array variable will be used as the ordinate, and each value corresponds to the bins. In the same way, the 'upper_bounds' and 'lower_bounds' variables are the corresponding upper and lower shaded parts, which represent the upper and lower bound errors of each score and must be shaded light grey in the table. 
    If the type of this feature is 'nominal', You should draw a bar chart.  Use the 'names' variable list content as the abscissa value and the 'scores' variable list content as the corresponding ordinate value. Additionally, the 'upper_bounds' and 'lower_bounds' variables which are the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding error bars in the figure respectively must be shaded in the table.
    The following are code examples for generating error bars for two types of features. You can imitate the corresponding code according to the target feature type, and add it to the original chart after generation:
    
    #the error bar of 'nominal' feature
    error_bars = alt.Chart(data).mark_errorbar(extent='ci').encode(
        x='feature',
        y=alt.Y('Lower Bound', title='Mean Contribution'),
        y2='Upper Bound'
    )
    
    # the error bar of 'continuous' feature
    error_bars =alt.Chart(data).mark_errorband().encode(
        x='feature',
        y='Upper Bound',
        y2='Lower Bound'
    )
    
    Keep in mind that the 'names' array variable may have one more data than the 'scores' array, check the lengths of the arrays before use and delete the last element if it is found to be different. Don't delete whthout check.
    To repeat, when you need to use the data in "ft_graph", you cannot use "print()" to print the data.
    
    The actual value of a feature has a huge impact on the predicted contribution, you must get it and show it in the chart so others can see it. You can try to reprint the sample data to get the actual value of the feature.
    When you use the contribution of each feature of a sample to plot, the variable of the coordinate axis is the name of the feature, such as 'Gender', but you must add the feature value enclosed in parentheses after the feature, such as 'Gender(Female)'.\n
