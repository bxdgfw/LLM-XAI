If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with `print(...)`.You can keep reusing this tool until you get the final answer.For chart plotting, the altair library is mandatory. Instead of saving your chart, display it using the `chart.display()` function rather than `chart.show()`.You can also add some required interactivity to the chart. When you update or modify the chart, you must make modifications on the original chart, which means that the existing parts of the original chart cannot be changed.\n",
      "Forecast: use this tool when you need to predict the probabilities given a series of feature values in a Generalized Additive Model.It will return the prediction result and probability. Your final answer must begin with the results returned and your thoughts about it, plus a conclusion based on the combination of the results returned and the description of the data set. To use the tool you must input a list consisting of the value of each feature. The value must be provided in question. For example, the question is: if a person's  Name is Jobs, height is 175cm, weight is 65kg, what is the prediction? you need to provide this tool with [' Jobs', 175, 65]. Remember to put quotes around the strings in the list.And there must be a space before the strings within the quotation marks. Also the order of elements should be consistent with the order of features in the data you see. \n",
      "Final_answer: Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Input should be what you want to respond and it will return the same. After using this tool, you must leave the results returned by this tool intact as Final Answer instead of continuing with other actions.\n",
      "Explanation_tool: use this tool When you need to get the contribution of each feature to the prediction outcome of a sample.A positive score indicates a positive contribution to the prediction result, otherwise it is a negative contribution. The larger the absolute value of the score, the greater the degree of contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use the following format:\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: the input question you must answer\n",
